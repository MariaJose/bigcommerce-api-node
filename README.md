# Bigcommerce for Node.js

A node module for authentication and communication with the BigCommerce API.

## Installation (In Development)

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-node.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned repository: `cd bigcommerce-api-node`
3. Run [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link): `npm link`

Now, you can navigate into the directory of some other package (e.g., [sample-app-nodejs](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs)) and run `npm link bigcommerce-api-node` which will then allow you to use and test this package as if it was downloaded from NPM.

## Usage

First, import the package into your project:

```js
import BigCommerce from 'bigcommerce-api-node';
```

Then, create a BigCommerce object with configuration options relevant to your use case.
### The BigCommerce Object

The main `BigCommerce` import is an object that contains properties for different use cases of the BigCommerce Node Client. The properties available are described below:

* `Auth`: This class can be instantiated and used to handle the OAuth flow that begins when a merchant clicks **Install** on a single-click app. 

## OAuth

The `bigcommerce-api-node` package can be used to handle the OAuth flow that begins when a merchant clicks **Install** on a single-click app.

First, create a BigCommerce object with `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `authCallback` as required configuration options:

```js
const bigcommerceAuth = new BigCommerce.Auth({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  authCallback: "https://yourapplication.com/auth",
});
```

The `bigcommerceAuth` object created above exposes two public methods: `authorize` and `verifyJWT`.

The `authorize` method takes one parameter â€” an object containing string values for `code`, `scope`, and `context`, which are provided by the GET request to your store when a merchant installs your app.

```js
const payload = await bigcommerceAuth.authorize({code, scope, context});
```

The object stored in the `payload` variable above will contain the following key/value pairs:

```js
{
  access_token: '123abc',
  scope: 'store_v2_orders etc.',
  user: {
    id: 12345,
    username: 'user.email@example.com',
    email: 'user.email@example.com',
  },
  context: 'stores/{STORE_HASH}',
  account_uuid: 'uuid-string'
}
```

The `verifyJWT` method can be used to verify and return the payload returned by the `load`, `uninstall`, and `remove User` callbacks. Each event triggers a GET request from BigCommerce to your app's callback endpoints containing a `signed_payload_jwt` as a query parameter. Once you parse the `signed_payload_jwt` from the request parameters, you can pass it to the `verifyJWT` method as follows:

```js
const payload = bigcommerceAuth.verifyJWT(signed_payload_jwt);
```

The object stored in the `payload` variable above will contain the following key/value pairs:

```js
{
  aud: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  iss: 'bc',
  iat: 1646844813,
  nbf: 1646844808,
  exp: 1646931213,
  jti: 'uuid-value',
  sub: 'stores/{STORE_HASH}',
  user: { id: 1470672, email: 'user.email@example.com' },
  owner: { id: 1470672, email: 'owner.email@example.com' },
  url: '/'
}
```
